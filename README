- Needed packages to compile (Debian Bullseye or Ubuntu 20.04): make, g++, libssl-dev, pkg-config, qtbase5-dev, libzip-dev
- Needed packages to run: Either just keep the above installed, or if you want to cleanup the dev stuff, you'll need:
- libqt5core5a, libqt5network5, libzip5 (Ubuntu) / libzip4 (Debian)



- Run "package_sources.sh" to checkout source code bundle. That bundle (tar.xz) should be included in the plugin.
- Run "bundle_calibre_plugin.sh" to create the Calibre Plugin using the source code.

- In folder "libgourou", run "scripts/setup.sh" then run "make BUILD_SHARED=1 BUILD_UTILS=1"
